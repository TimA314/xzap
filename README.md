# XZap ⚡

**Lightning Bitcoin Payments on X.com**

XZap enhances your X.com experience by adding a Zap button (⚡) to posts, enabling instant Lightning Bitcoin payments to creators and users directly on the platform.

## Features

- **Effortless Zapping**: Send Bitcoin tips via the Lightning Network with one click.
- **QR Code Integration**: Embeds your Lightning Address as a scannable QR code in your X.com profile picture.
- **Customizable Defaults**: Set a default Zap amount for quick payments, adjustable anytime.
- **WebLN Support**: Streamlined payments with WebLN-compatible wallets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple popup to manage your Lightning Address and settings.

## How It Works

1. Install XZap and set your Lightning Address in the popup.
2. XZap embeds your address as a QR code in your X.com profile picture.
3. On X.com posts, click the Zap button to send Bitcoin to users with a detectable Lightning Address.
4. Without WebLN, scan QR codes or copy addresses to pay users manually.

## Why Use XZap?

- Support creators and friends with quick Bitcoin tips.
- Enjoy seamless payments without leaving X.com.
- Benefit from the Lightning Network’s fast, low-cost transactions.

## Installation

1. Download XZap from the [Chrome Web Store](insert_link_here).
2. Click the extension icon, enter your Lightning Address, and start zapping!

**Note**: Requires a Lightning Network wallet. WebLN support is optional but recommended for the best experience. Currently, XZap works only on x.com (not the mobile app). App integration is under exploration.

## Privacy

XZap prioritizes your privacy:
- Does not collect or store personal data.
- All payments are securely processed via the Lightning Network.
- User preferences (e.g., default Zap amount) are stored locally using `chrome.storage.local`.
